# Core-utils (Go)

This is an implementation of the
[POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap04.html)
standard utilities written in Go.

[Decoded Core
Utils](http://www.maizure.org/projects/decoded-gnu-coreutils/) is a
helpful resource that contains explainations of each command's execution
workflow.

### Information:

#### Behavior:

These utilities should be nearly identical to GNU's coreutils.

Since parsing the output of shell commands isn't uncommon (even if
it *is* bad behavior), most of the commands should have output that
is nearly identical to the original GNU commands.

Do note that sometimes the results could differ a little for select commands.

For example, GNU's `wc` utility relies on the current locale to determine
whether it should parse multi-byte characters or not.

The Go version, on the other hand, uses the `unicode/utf8` package
which natively detects multi-byte sequences. The trade-off is this: the
Go version is technically more correct, while the C version is faster.
